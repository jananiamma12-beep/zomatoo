    <h2>Qualitity</h2>
    Factors Affecting Food Quality and Taste:
    Restaurant Choice: The quality of food is ultimately the responsibility of the restaurant partner, not Zomato
    itself. This means that the food quality can vary greatly depending on the specific restaurant you choose.
    Restaurant Practices: Some restaurants may not maintain consistent quality or hygiene standards.
    Individual Preferences: Taste is subjective, and what one person enjoys, another may not.

    Factors Affecting Delivery:
    Delivery Time:
    Zomato's delivery times can be affected by various factors such as restaurant preparation time, traffic conditions,
    and the distance between the restaurant and the delivery location.
    Delivery Partner Performance:
    While Zomato has a large network of delivery partners, occasional issues with delivery personnel, such as delays or
    incorrect deliveries, can occur.
    <p style="text-align: center;">Zomato's food quality, taste, and delivery experiences can vary significantly. While
        Zomato aims to connect users with diverse restaurants and provide convenient delivery, customer reviews
        highlight inconsistencies in food quality, taste, and delivery times. Some users report excellent experiences
        with delicious food and efficient delivery, while others have faced issues like stale food, incorrect orders,
        and delayed or even canceled deliveries. </p>
